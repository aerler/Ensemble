# Ensemble

A container class that holds several datasets ("members" of the ensemble), furthermore, the Ensemble class provides
functionality to execute Dataset class methods collectively for all members, and return the results in a tuple.

This document will be updated as we develop the module and hopefully this will allow different interested parties to
peruse the code and / or help improve it.
